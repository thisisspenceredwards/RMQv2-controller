Need to set up two service files.

One for systemd and one for avahi.

Both will be in the repo.

For the systemd service, to start it on boot we need to run:

sudo systemctl enable runRabbit.service 

location for avahi: /etc/avahi/services/

after making updates to the avahi service: sudo service avahi-daemon restart


location for systemd: /usr/lib/systemd/system
